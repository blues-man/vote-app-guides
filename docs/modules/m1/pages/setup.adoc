# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Overview - Setup

In this section, we'll take a look at the architecture that this lab will be using.

NOTE: Everything has already been pre-installed on your cluster, so there's no need to do anything here. This is just for reference.

## Lab Architecture

To run this lab, we're using an OpenShift 4.12 cluster. This cluster has been pre-configured with the following:

### Operator: OpenShift Pipelines 
*OpenShift Pipelines* is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution for building pipelines using Tekton. Tekton is a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating deployments across multiple platforms (Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, etc) by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.

Follow these instructions in order to install OpenShift Pipelines on OpenShift via the OperatorHub:

- From the left-side menu under *Administrator* perspective, go to
*Operators*-> *OperatorHub*. In the search box, search for _OpenShift Pipelines_,
then click to *OpenShift Pipelines*:

.OperatorHub

- From the description view, click _Install_ to review all installation
settings.

Pipelines]

- After few seconds, the installation should be completed with success and
you can verify it looking at _Status_ column, check if the status is
_Succeeded_.

### Operator: OpenShift GitOps 
*OpenShift GitOps* is a GitOps operator for OpenShift that provides a declarative, GitOps oriented approach to managing applications and their delivery. It provides a set of core GitOps operators and APIs for declaratively managing your cluster configuration and application delivery using Git as the source of truth.

Follow these instructions in order to install OpenShift GitOps on OpenShift via the OperatorHub.

- From the left-side menu under *Administrator* perspective, go to
*Operators*-> *OperatorHub*. In the search box, search for _OpenShift GitOps_,
then click to *OpenShift GitOps*:

- From the description view, click _Install_ to review all installation
settings.

- After few seconds, the installation should be completed with success and
you can verify it looking at _Status_ column, check if the status is
_Succeeded_.

### Operator: OpenShift Dev Spaces
*Openshift Dev Spaces* is a cloud-native, developer workspace server and IDE for OpenShift. It allows developers to quickly create cloud-native applications by allowing them to focus on coding while the tooling takes care of the rest.

Follow these instructions in order to install OpenShift Dev Spaces on OpenShift via the OperatorHub:

- From the left-side menu under *Administrator* perspective, go to
*Operators*-> *OperatorHub*. In the search box, search for _OpenShift Dev Spaces_,
then click to *OpenShift Dev Spaces*:

- From the description view, click _Install_ to review all installation
settings.

- After few seconds, the installation should be completed with success and
you can verify it looking at _Status_ column, check if the status is
_Succeeded_.

### Operator: OpenShift Web Terminal
The *Web Terminal* is a web-based terminal for OpenShift. It allows users to access a terminal in a pod from the OpenShift Web Console.

Follow these instructions in order to install OpenShift GitOps on OpenShift via the OperatorHub.

Log into OpenShift Web Console as a cluster admin and navigate to the
*Administrator* perspective and then *Operators* â†’ *OperatorHub*.

In the *OperatorHub*, search for _Web Terminal_ and follow the
operator install flow to install it.

## Lab Checks

### ArgoCD

link:https://argocd-server-argocd-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*ArgoCD*] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes provided in the OpenShift GitOps Operator. From your OpenShift cluster, you can acess the ArgoCD dashboard.

image::argocd-button.png[ArgoCD]

You'll be able to access the ArgoCD UI via OpenShift using the following credentials:

- Username: `%USERID%`
- Password: `openshift`

You'll need to authorize the ArgoCD application to access your OpenShift cluster. Click on the *Allow selected permissions* button to authorize ArgoCD to access your OpenShift cluster. Finally, you'll be at the ArgoCD dashboard.

### Vote App Repository

You'll also have access to a link:http://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%[*Gitea*] repository that contains the Vote App source code. This repository can also be located back at the *Lab Guides*, and you'll be able to access this repository using following credentials:

- Username: `%USERID%`
- Password: `openshift`

image::gitea.png[Gitea]

Once logged in, you can access the following Vote App source repositories:

- link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/pipelines-vote-ui[Gitea Vote App UI Frontend]
- link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/pipelines-vote-api[Gitea Vote App API Backend]

We also have a repository that contains the ArgoCD application manifests for the Vote App.

## Lab overview

Your cluster is already configured with the appropriate OpenShift project, configured secrets and service accounts, and necessary Git repositories. From here, we can wrap up the introduction and begin our lab!

// For Pipelines: Using gitea-gitops secret to login to the Gitea repository
// When you use 

// First user starts the pipeline, then deploys app in the dev namespace by using argoCD within argocd namespace or by using link from Lab Guides, user will login to argocd and create a new app `vote-app-dev-user`, sync automatic, no self heal, repository is vote-app-gitops on gitea, 

// Create pipeline, add webhook, create argo app, edit in devspaces locally then commit push, pipeline will redeploy, use promote to prod pipeline
