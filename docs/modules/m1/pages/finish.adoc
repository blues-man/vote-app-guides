# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Overview - Finish

Congratulations! Your environment is successfully set up for the Vote App lab, complete with the required OpenShift operators, and repositories ready to go.

## Next Steps

You, lets proceed to the Demo section to create the new pipeline, create the application from ArgoCD, then modify the app Vote App using OpenShift DevSpaces and finally deploy it to your OpenShift cluster.

Head to the _Developer_ perspective, and under _Topology_, click *create a Project* from the top area.
