# Vote App Lab Overview - Introduction

Welcome to the Red Hat Summit 2023 Vote App Lab, we're glad to have you here with us!

## About this lab

This lab will guide you through the process of inner and outer loop development, using link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[OpenShift Dev Spaces] to code and push changes to a Git repository, as well as start Tekton pipelines using link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/5ec54a4628834587a6b85ca5[OpenShift Pipelines]. Then, we'll use Argo CD with link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/gitops[OpenShift GitOps] to sync our application in both development and production environments. Through this lab, you'll learn how to set up and manage the entire application lifecycle within a Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

## Introduction

The Vote App is a simple application that allows users to vote for their favorite option, currently a cat or dog, and view the results. In this lab, you will be working with two main components: the `vote-api` (Go) and the `vote-ui` (Python).

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how to create a seamless CI/CD pipeline using OpenShift, Tekton, Argo CD, and OpenShift Dev Spaces. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of:

- Understanding Tekton pipeline manifests, starting them manually, and connecting webhooks for automation
- Using Argo CD to deploy our application to a development environment
- Development and local testing of application code using OpenShift Dev Spaces within the web browser
- Ensuring high-availability of our application using Argo CD in a production environment

## Next Steps

Ready to get started with the lab? Let's begin, firstly by learning a bit of theory about the inner vs outer loop of development.
