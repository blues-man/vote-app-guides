# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Overview - Introduction

## About this lab

This lab will guide you through the process of creating a CI/CD pipeline for a sample Vote App using OpenShift, Tekton, ArgoCD, Quay.io, and CodeReady Workspaces. You will learn how to set up and manage the entire application lifecycle, from development to production.

## Introduction

The Vote App is a simple application that allows users to vote for their favorite option and view the results. In this lab, you will be working with two main components: the vote-api and the vote-ui.

The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how to create a seamless CI/CD pipeline using OpenShift, Tekton, ArgoCD, Quay.io, and OpenShift DevSpaces. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of:

- Creating Tekton pipeline manifests
- Setting up webhooks for pipeline automation
- Deploying applications using ArgoCD
- Managing application drifts and syncing
- Collaborating on code using CodeReady Workspaces
