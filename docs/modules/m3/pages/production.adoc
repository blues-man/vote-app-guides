# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Production - Pushing to Production

Now, it's time to push our application to production. We'll be using one last pipeline, `promote-to-prod`, to tag our image, push it to the `vote-app-prod-%USERID%` environment, then update the repository with this new image digest. Then, we'll use Argo CD to create a new `prod` application with self-healing enabled. Finally, we'll use Git to modify the application, scaling up the deployment replicas and viewing this high-availability in real-time from the OpenShift Web Console.

## Viewing the `promote-to-prod` pipeline

Firstly, ensure that you're currently using the `vote-app-ci-%USERID%` project. This is where our pipeline manifests have been created, and where we'll be running the pipeline from.

Within this Pipelines dashboard, you will see a list of pipelines. Click on the `promote-to-prod` pipeline to see the details of the pipeline.

image::pipeline-prod-details.png[]

Here, you can go through the pipeline steps and see what each step is doing. You can also see the pipeline resources that are being used. In addition, you can see the pipeline parameters that are being used.  These parameters are used to pass in the name of the image that will be built, and the name of the image that will be pushed to the registry.

For reference, here's the pipeline steps:

- `tag-to-prod`: This step tags the image from the `dev` project and pushes it to the `prod` project.
- `image-tag-to-digest`: This step tags the image with the digest of the image that was pushed to the `prod` project.
- `git-update-deployment`: This step updates the `vote-app-gitops` repository with the new image digest.

## Running the `promote-to-prod` pipeline

Here, we can go ahead and start the Pipeline. Click on the top-right *Actions* then *Start* button to start the pipeline. The steps are the same as the previous pipelines, so we won't go through them again.

image::pipeline-prod-ui-start.png[]

You will be prompted to enter the values for the pipeline parameters, however the default values are already set for you. You'll need to specify a *Empty Directory* for the `app-source` parameter. This is because we're not building the application from source, we're using the image that was built in the `dev` project. Click on the *Start* button to start the pipeline.

Now that the `promote-to-prod` pipeline has been started, let's go ahead and check the status of the pipeline.

image::pipeline-prod-ui-status.png[]

Once the pipeline has completed, you'll notice that the `vote-app-gitops` repo has been updated with a new hash of an image. This is the image that was built in the `dev` project, and pushed to the `prod` project, and referenced in the `environments/prod/kustomization.yaml` file that can be found link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops/src/branch/main/environments/prod/kustomization.yaml[*here*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

## Deploying the application to production using Argo CD

Within the link:https://argocd-server-argocd-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*Argo CD*,role='params-link',window='_blank'] dashboard, click on the `+ New App` button.

image::argocd-new-app.png[]

Fill in the following information, many of which may auto-fill when selected:

* Application Name: `vote-app-prod-%USERID%`
* Project: `default`
* Sync Policy: `Automatic`
* Self-Healing: `Enabled`
* Auto-create Namespace: `Enabled`
* Repository URL: `http://gitea.gitea.svc:3000/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops`
* Revision: `main`
* Path: `environments/prod`
* Cluster URL: `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
* Namespace: `vote-app-prod-%USERID%`

image::argocd-new-app-2.png[]
image::argocd-new-app-3.png[]

Click on the *Create* button to create the application. You will be taken to the application details page. Here, you can see the application's health, sync status, and associated resources. Currently, the application is syncing, so the status is `OutOfSync`. Once the application is synced, the status will change to a green `Synced`.

## Reviewing SyncWaves in Argo CD

Argo CD has a feature called https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/sync-waves/[Syncwaves,window='_blank'], which allows you to deploy applications in a staggered fashion. This is useful when you have multiple applications that are dependent on each other, and you want to deploy them in a specific order. For example, you may have a database application that you want to deploy first, then your application that depends on the database. You can use SyncWaves to deploy the database application first, then the application that depends on the database.

In our case, let's see SyncWaves in action. Let's visit the `vote-app-gitops` production kustomization.yaml file link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops/src/branch/main/environments/prod/kustomization.yaml[*here*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

<1> Here we are using Kustomize to add SyncWaves as annotations to the Kubernetes manifests for production
<2> The SyncWaves cardinality defines the order of deployment, in this case we want to deploy first the backend and then the frontend
<3> With Kustomize we can define which manifest to match for the patch, in this case Deployments, Services and Routes.

With our configuration currently, SyncWaves allow for a controlled rollout of resources by setting a sequence in which they should be deployed. In this case, we have multiple resources, `vote-api` and `vote-ui`. The `vote-api` resources have syncwaves of `0` and `1`, whereas the `vote-ui` resources have a syncwave of `2`, `3` and `4`. This means that the `vote-api` resource will be deployed first, then the `vote-ui` resource will be deployed second.

## Viewing the application and detecting drift

Now that the application has been deployed to production, let's go ahead and view the application in the OpenShift console. Click on the *Developer* perspective, then click on the *Topology* view. Ensure you're in the `vote-app-prod-%USERID%` application, and you should see the application deployed.

image::app-prod-topology.png[]

Click on the `vote-ui` deployment, and click *Details* to see the details of the deployment. Here, you see how Argo CD will auto-detect drift in the application. Let's go ahead and change the number of replicas to `2`, and see how Argo CD detects the drift and auto-heals.

image::app-prod-topology-2.png[]

Almost immediately after scaling up the replicas for the `vote-ui` deployment, Argo CD notices this drift, and auto-corrects us back to `1` replicas. Pretty neat!

## Using Git to modify the application

Now, let's go ahead and make a change to the application. We'll change the number of replicas to `2`, and see how Argo CD detects the drift and auto-heals. To do this, let's go ahead and modify the `environments/prod/kustomization.yaml` file in the `vote-app-gitops` repository. You can do this by clicking on the *Code* tab, then clicking on the `environments/prod/kustomization.yaml` file link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops/src/branch/main/environments/prod/kustomization.yaml[*here*,role='params-link',window='_blank'], then clicking on the *Edit* button.

image::gitops-prod-kustomization.png[]

Change the number of replicas on line 4 to `2`, then navigate to the *Commit changes* section at the bottom of the page. Here, we can select *Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request*. We will create a new branch, `%USERID%-feature-id` and start a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch. Click on the *Propose file change* button to create the pull request.

image::gitops-prod-kustomization-2.png[]

You will be taken to the *New Pull Request* page. Here, you can see the changes that were made to the file. Click on the *New Pull Request* button to create the pull request.

image::gitops-prod-kustomization-3.png[]

Now, you'll see a new page to create a pull request. Here, you can see the details of the pull request. Click on the *Create pull request* button to create the pull request.

image::gitops-prod-kustomization-4.png[]

With the new pull request created, let's go ahead and merge the pull request. Click on the *Create merge commit* button to merge the pull request.

image::gitops-prod-kustomization-5.png[]

## Viewing the application and detecting drift

Now, let's go ahead and check the status of the application in the OpenShift console. Click on the *Developer* perspective, then click on the *Topology* view. Ensure you're in the `vote-app-prod-%USERID%` application, and you should see the `vote-ui` deployed, now with 2 replicas.

image::app-prod-topology-3.png[]

Click on the `vote-ui` deployment, and click *Details* to see the details of the deployment. Here, you see how Argo CD will auto-detect drift in the application. Let's go ahead and change the number of replicas to `1`, and see how Argo CD detects the drift and auto-heals.

image::app-prod-topology-4.png[]

Automatically, the application will sync, Argo CD uses the manifests in the `vote-app-gitops` repository to detect these drifts and keep us at `2` replicas. We can also see this in Argo CD, where auto sync is enabled.

## Conclusion

In this section, we learned how to use Tekton GitOps to deploy an application from a development to a production environment, and how to use Argo CD to detect drift in the application and auto-heal the application.
