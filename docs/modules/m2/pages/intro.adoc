# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Development - Introduction

## Introduction

In this module, we'll start by creating a basic CI/CD pipeline using Tekton and OpenShift. We'll then deploy our application to a development environment using ArgoCD. Next, we'll make changes to the code and push them to the repository. We'll see how Tekton automatically detects the changes and triggers a new build. We'll then deploy the new version of the application to the development environment

Let's begin!
