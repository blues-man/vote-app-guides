# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Demo - CodeReady Workspaces

With the Vote Application deployed to our `vote-app-dev-%USERID` project, we can now use CodeReady Workspaces to develop and test our application. CodeReady Workspaces is a browser-based IDE that allows you to develop in the cloud. It provides a ready-to-use development stack with a web-based IDE, terminal, and version control support. It also provides pre-built developer workspaces that allow you to start coding immediately.

## Getting setup with CodeReady Workspaces

Let's start out with getting more familiar with the CodeReady Workspaces interface. To do this, we can begin with navigating to CodeReady Workspaces from the OpenShift Console. To do this, click on the menu icon on the top right corner and select `CodeReady Workspaces`.

This will open up the CodeReady Workspaces interface. From here, we can begin to make our changes to the Vote Application. But first, let's get familiar with the powerful features of CodeReady Workspaces.

Built from the open Eclipse Che project, CodeReady Workspaces provides support for Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions and Language Server Protocol. This means that you can use your favorite Visual Studio Code extensions in CodeReady Workspaces. You can also use the Language Server Protocol to provide language features like auto-complete, go-to-definition, and hover support.

CodeReady Workspaces also provides a terminal that allows you to run commands in your workspace. This is useful for running commands like `mvn clean package` or `npm install` to build your application. You can also use the terminal to run commands like `oc login` to login to your OpenShift cluster.

CodeReady Workspaces also provides a built-in version control system. This allows you to commit and push your changes to a Git repository. You can also use the version control system to pull changes from a Git repository.

## Editing the Vote Application in CodeReady Workspaces

From the CodeReady Workspaces interface, we can now begin to make changes to the Vote Application. To do this, we can edit the `index.html` file in the `templates` directory.

Here, on line 16, we can change the text from `{{option_a}} vs {{option_b}}!` to `{{option_a}} vs {{option_b}}! - Red Hat Summit 2023`. This will change the title of the Vote Application to `Vote App - Red Hat Summit 2023`.

Now before pushing our changes to the repository, we can test our changes by running the Vote Application locally. From the top right corner, we can select *Terminal* and then *Run Task*. From here, we can select *Show all tasks* and *devfile: Install dependencies*. This will install the dependencies for the Vote Application.

Next, we can select *Terminal* and then *Run Task* again. From here, we can select *Show all tasks* and *devfile: Run Python App*. This will run the Vote Application in development.

You'll now see a pop-up in the lower right corner about a new process running on port 8080.

From here, we can click on the *Open* button to open the Vote Application in a new browser tab. It may take a few seconds, but you should see the Vote Application running.

## Pushing changes to the Git repository

Now that we've tested our changes, we can push our changes to the Git repository. To do this, we can select the *Source Control* tab from the left menu. From here, we can select the *âœ“ Commit* button to stage all of our changes. We can then enter a commit message and commit as well as push our changes to the Git repository.

Finally, you'll need to enter your credentials to push your changes to the Git repository. 

- Username: `%USERID%`
- Password: `openshift`

## Deploying changes to the Vote Application

Now that we've pushed our changes to the Git repository, and with the webhook configured, our changes will be automatically deployed to the Vote Application. To see this, we can navigate to the OpenShift Console and select the `vote-app-ci-%USERID` project. From here, we can select *Pipelines* from the left menu. We should see the pipeline `vote-app-ci-pipeline` running and rebuilding the Vote Application.

Once the pipeline has completed, in the `vote-app-gitops` repository, there will be a new commit from Tekton that will contain the new hash for the Vote Application image.

This will trigger ArgoCD to deploy the new image to the `vote-app-dev-%USERID` project. To view this, head back to ArgoCD and select the `vote-app-dev-%USERID` application. You'll see that the application is now out of sync as we declared in our `Application` resource that we wanted didn't want _self-healing_ enabled. From the top menu, click on *Sync* and then *Synchronize*. This will deploy the new image to the `vote-app-dev-%USERID` project.

## Next steps

This is satisfactory for our development environment, but let's push this application to production. For this, we can use a separate pipeline that will deploy the application to the `vote-app-prod-%USERID` project.
