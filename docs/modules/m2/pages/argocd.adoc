# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Development - Argo CD

Now, the next step is to deploy the Vote App to the dev environment using Argo CD.

## Creating a new application using Argo CD

Let's use Argo CD to create a new application. While you can use this https://argocd-server-argocd-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[Argo CD,role='params-link',window='_blank']. link to login to the Argo CD dashboard, you can also head to Argo CD from within your cluster by visiting the `argocd-%USERID%` project in the OpenShift web console.

Then, click on the `Login with OpenShift` button.

Within the Argo CD web console, click on the `+ New App` button.

Fill in the following information, many of which may auto-fill when selected:

* Application Name: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`
* Project: `default`
* Sync Policy: `Automatic`
* Self-Healing: `Disabled`
* Auto-create Namespace: `Enabled`
* Repository URL: `http://gitea.gitea.svc:3000/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops`
* Revision: `main`
* Path: `environments/dev`
* Cluster URL: `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
* Namespace: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`

Click on the `CREATE` button.

## Viewing the application in ArgoCD

Now, let's view the application in ArgoCD. After creating the application, you should be redirected to the application details page. Click on the application's name to view the application details.

Here, you see the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application's status, resources, and history. Currently, the application is syncing, so the status is `OutOfSync`. Once the application is synced, the status will change to `Synced`.

## Viewing the application in the OpenShift web console

Now, let's link:https://vote-ui-vote-app-dev-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*view the application*,role='params-link',window='_blank'] in the OpenShift web console. From the OpenShift web console in the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, click on the `Topology` tab.

To access the application, click on the `vote-app` route icon, which will open the application in a new tab.

## Using the Web Terminal to modify the development project

Now, let's use the web terminal to modify the development project and demonstrate that we have not yet put in place self-healing or high availability just yet. From the OpenShift web console in the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, click on the *Terminal* icon from the top right of the page.

From the web terminal, run the following command scale up the `vote-ui` deployment to 2 replicas:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc scale deployment vote-ui --replicas=2
----

This command will scale up the `vote-ui` deployment to 2 replicas. Now, we can return to Argo CD to see how the application is out of sync.

Now, click *Sync* and select *Synchronize* to sync the application back to the manifests in the link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops[Gitea Vote App GitOps,,role='params-link',window='_blank'] repository.

## Next Steps

Now that you have deployed the Vote App to the dev environment using Argo CD, we can use OpenShift DevSpaces to develop and test the application locally before moving to the `vote-app-prod-%USERID%` environment and implementing self-healing and high availability.
