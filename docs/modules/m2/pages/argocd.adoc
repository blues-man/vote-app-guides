# Red Hat Summit 2023: Vote App Lab Development - ArgoCD

Now, the next step is to deploy the Vote App to the dev environment using ArgoCD.

## Creating a new application using ArgoCD

Let's use the ArgoCD CLI to create a new application. From the OpenShift web console, click on the menu icon on the top right corner and select `ArgoCD`.

Fill in the following information, many of which may auto-fill when selected:

* Application Name: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`
* Project: `default`
* Sync Policy: `Automatic`
* Self-Healing: `Disabled`
* Auto-create Namespace: `Enabled`
* Repository URL: `http://gitea.gitea.svc:3000/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops`
* Revision: `main`
* Path: `environments/dev`
* Cluster URL: `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
* Namespace: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`

Click on the `CREATE` button.

## Viewing the application in ArgoCD

Now, let's view the application in ArgoCD. After creating the application, you should be redirected to the application details page. Click on the application's name to view the application details.

Here, you see the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application's status, resources, and history. Currently, the application is syncing, so the status is `OutOfSync`. Once the application is synced, the status will change to `Synced`.

## Viewing the application in the OpenShift web console

Now, let's view the application in the OpenShift web console. From the OpenShift web console in the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, click on the `Topology` tab.

## Next Steps

Now that you have deployed the Vote App to the dev environment using ArgoCD, we can use OpenShift DevSpaces to develop and test the application locally before moving to the `prod` environment.
